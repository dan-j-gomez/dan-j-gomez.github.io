Structural molecular biology is a scientific field that studies the structure, function, and interactions of biological macromolecules, such as proteins, nucleic acids, and complex assemblies. This field combines techniques from various disciplines, including X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, electron microscopy, biochemistry, and computational modeling, to determine the three-dimensional structures of these molecules and understand how they work at the molecular level.

The structural information obtained from these studies is critical for understanding the mechanisms of biological processes and developing new drugs and therapies to treat diseases. Structural molecular biology has applications in many areas, including drug design, biotechnology, bioengineering, and molecular genetics.
