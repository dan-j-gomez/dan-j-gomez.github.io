Photon science is a scientific field that studies the properties and behavior of light, particularly in its interactions with matter. It encompasses a broad range of scientific disciplines, including physics, chemistry, biology, and materials science, and involves the use of advanced experimental techniques and technologies to study the fundamental properties of light and its interactions with matter.

Photon science research often focuses on the study of synchrotron radiation, free-electron lasers, and other high-intensity light sources, which are used to investigate the structure and properties of matter at the atomic and molecular level. This includes the study of materials properties, chemical reactions, biological molecules, and fundamental physical processes.

The applications of photon science are broad and include materials science, biotechnology, nanotechnology, energy research, and environmental science. For example, it can be used to design and optimize new materials with specific properties, understand the mechanisms of biological processes, and study the impact of environmental pollutants on living organisms.
