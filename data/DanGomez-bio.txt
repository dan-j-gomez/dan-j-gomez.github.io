Research Thesis Project: Leading a collaborative effort at Stanford University to map exercise-induced exerkines across organs using fusion and image-staining algorithms, deep omics profiling and spatial omics. Integrate data from preclinical models and humans, analyze multi-omics datasets to collect, model, process, connect exerkines across organ architecture/tissue microenvironments, cell/molecular networks, and nuclear organization. Contribute to precision medicine by upgrading the novel multiplex imaging and analysis in intra-organ communication via spatial tissue maps with proper cell annotation, image segmentation, clustering niches into community plots, neighborhoods, cell types/subtypes, differential gene expression, and advancing single-cell and spatial omics technologies. This will provide insights about how exerkines prevent, manage, and treat disease while predicting health outcomes (patient stratification, survivability).
