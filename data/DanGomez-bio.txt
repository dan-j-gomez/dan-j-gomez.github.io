Daniel Gomez is the founder of Gomera Research in San Francisco Bay Area, where he works on biomedical science 
and machine learning. He is a Graduate Student at California State University, East Bay and his thesis research cohort 
spans the entire Bay Area including collaborations at UCSF, and SSRL at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. 
His thesis committee has members from UC Berkeley, Stanford University, and CSUEB. He received a BS in Molecular Biology 
from San Francisco State University in 2022, where he was advised by Nicole Salazar. He transferred from University of Hawaii 
at MƒÅnoa's (UHM) BS in Molecular Cell Biology program. He did research all around the United States in many different 
laboratories mostly in medical schools. He received a many certificates in Data Science & Machine Learning, Go, C++, 
Linear Algebra from Udemy since 2016. He also completed the Medical School Pathology certificate from Dr. Minarcik. 
He has been award the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP) grant at UHM. He was also awarded and

Message about my educational path: 
<p>
        I am doing my first masters at <a href="https://www.csueastbay.edu/">Cal State East Bay (CSUEB)</a> in Biological Sciences with a concentration in Virophysics and Structural Molecular Biology. You can read more about this in my <a href="https://danigomez.com/about/">About</a> page.
        I'm planning on doing a second masters in Molecular Science and Software Engineering (<a href="https://msse.berkeley.edu">MSSE</a>) at UC Berkeley or a MS in Neuroimaging and Informatics <a href="https://niin.usc.edu/">(NIIN)</a> at <a href="https://usc.edu">USC</a>.
        In the future, I will be working to complete a PhD in Physical Biology, Bioinformatics: Biological and Medical Informatics (BMI), or Structural, Computational Biology and Neurophysics/Biophysics.

        While finishing my degree, I took classes in Cancer Biology, Genetics, Honors Genetics, Biochemistry I & II, General Virology, Physics, and Experiments in Cell and Molecular Biology that prepared me for graduate studies.
        I received my <a href="https://www.parchment.com/u/award/9fd083fdc52c0fbd34814acfc02a48fe">Bachelor of Science in Molecuar Cell Biology</a> from <a href="https://sfsu.edu">SFSU</a>,<strong> Class of 2022</strong>, where I conducted research with <a href="https://biology.sfsu.edu/faculty/roy">Scott Roy</a> and <a href=https://nicolesalazarlab.com/">Nicole Salazar</a>. This research with Dr. Salazar was successful and she continues to study chemokines in cancer.
        Since getting my degree, I instantly aligned with the largest biotechnology company in the world <a href="https://diagnostics.roche.com/us/en/home.html">Roche Diagnostics</a>. I was working in Department of Antibody Formulations of Roche Tissue Diagnostics (RTD). I desired to do my own research and joined an active research lab at <a href="https://drexel.edu/medicine/">Drexel University College of Medicine</a> in the
        <a href="https://drexel.edu/medicine/about/departments/microbiology-immunology/">Department of Microbiology & Immunology</a>. We focused on dendritic cells (DCs) and then explored neurological infections which I had been researching for a decade at this point. I co-first authored a publication in co-infection and cancer. This review paper has been cited four times as of March 2023 and one citation was for a PhD student to obtain their
        doctorate degree in their dissertation. Other articles are building on our research to tell a story about microbes and their impact on cancer. I kept researching and publishing in cancer as I got started in a MS program at CSUEB. I continue to write, take graduate classes, and review and edit research publications in the scientific and medical community. I have been invited to speak and give presentations in conferences around the world.
