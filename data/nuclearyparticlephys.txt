Nuclear physics is a branch of physics that deals with the properties, behavior, and interactions of atomic nuclei. It studies the structure and properties of atomic nuclei, including their binding energy, stability, and decay modes, as well as the processes by which nuclei are formed, modified, and transformed. Nuclear physics also investigates the interactions between atomic nuclei and subatomic particles, such as protons, neutrons, and electrons, and their applications in energy generation, medicine, and material science.

Particle physics, on the other hand, is the study of the fundamental particles and their interactions. It seeks to understand the nature and properties of particles such as quarks, leptons, and gauge bosons, and the fundamental forces that govern their interactions. Particle physics also explores the structure and properties of the universe at the smallest scales, and seeks to answer fundamental questions such as the origin of mass, the nature of dark matter, and the properties of the Higgs boson.

Both nuclear and particle physics are closely related and often overlap, as they share similar experimental techniques and theoretical models. They have many applications in areas such as energy, medicine, and technology, and have contributed significantly to our understanding of the physical world.
