Astrostructural Biology is a multidisciplinary field that studies the structural and functional properties of biomolecules in extraterrestrial environments. This field combines elements of structural biology, astrophysics, and astrobiology to investigate how the physical and chemical properties of molecules and biomolecules may be affected by extreme conditions found in space and on other planets.

Astrostructural Biology involves the analysis of biomolecules in various forms, including proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, and carbohydrates. Researchers in this field study how biomolecules can form and function in extraterrestrial environments, including the effects of radiation, temperature extremes, and low pressure. They also investigate how biomolecules may have played a role in the origin and evolution of life on Earth and other planets.

Overall, Astrostructural Biology seeks to understand how the properties of biomolecules are affected by different environmental conditions, and how these properties may impact the possibility of life in the universe.
